My name is Mohammad Meraj, but my friends often call me Eyman.

I'm based in Plano, Texas, with a background in biomedical engineering from Iran. I'm passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive innovation.

Currently, I'm pursuing further education in data science in the United States.
